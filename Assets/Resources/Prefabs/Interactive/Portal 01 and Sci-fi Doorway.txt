The Sci-fi Doorway needs scripts

 - boolean activation compatable with switches
 - opening and closing the doors
 - triggers to open the door
 - light activation (material swap) to show that the door can be opened

The current model does not have textures.
This may be added in the future to the prefab.






Portal01 model needs a trigger and script for entering the portal - loading the next scene, mission complete, etc...

The portal will also need custom baked reflection probes to display the area inside the portal.
