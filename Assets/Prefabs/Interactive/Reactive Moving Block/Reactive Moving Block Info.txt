Reactive moving blocks need a script


These blocks/platforms activate if the player is on top of them and match the color on one of the sides.
If multiple colors are the same then it will toggle clockwise each time the player activates that color.

The blocks can potentially move in 4 directions forward, backward, left, and right.
The maximum distance the blocks can move until stopped in X direction will also customizable variables.
The blocks will also stop if they run into a wall.

Each side of the block (not including top and bottom) can be assigned a red, green, blue, yellow, or blank state.
A blank side will do nothing and cannot be activated.
The colored sides can be activated by the player and will move in the direction of the arrow.
When a side is activated, the material will swap to a glowing version and particles (with matching colors) on that side will be activated.

The player must move along with the velocity of the platforms and not lock up the movement of the player.
The block platform must not slide past the player.






Potential states for the sides of the platform:

0 - Neutral texture, cannot be activated
1 - Red inactive (can be activated by a red player)
2 - Green inactive (can be activated by a green player)
3 - Blue inactive (can be activated by a blue player)
4 - Yellow inactive (can be activated by a yellow player)
11 - Red active (active as long as the player remains red and the player is on top of the platform)
12 - Green active (active as long as the player remains green and the player is on top of the platform)
13 - Blue active (active as long as the player remains blue and the player is on top of the platform)
14 - Yellow active (active as long as the player remains yellow and the player is on top of the platform)




Potential Variables:

// The state of each platform side - this will also determine the materials used on each side, and the activation of particles
int leftSideState
int rightSideState
int frontSideState
int backSideState

// The max distance/range the platform may travel
float leftSideRange
float rightSideRange
float frontSideRange
float backSideRange


// A clockwise offset for the starting side variable may be needed if it is desired to
// have the platform move in a specific starting direction in the case of multiple of the same color.


// Because the materials change based on the states set it would be very helpful to allow this to work within the Unity editor.
